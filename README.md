GIFTASTIC


Project title
This is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice from the GIPHY API. It can be run on the user’s browser. This particular web page is Mario themed. Pre-made buttons exist including the names of Mario characters and the user has the choice of adding additional character gifs with the use of the search bar and submit button. The Super Mario Bros theme song plays in the background when the document loads. 

Motivation
During the course of studying web development through the University of Kansas, it became apparent that it was important to learn how to use web APIs. This project was a fundamental project in learning the techniques of using web APIs for future development.

Challenges
At one point during the creation of this web page, my gifs were populating in an unusual order, when the first button was clicked the user received 6 gifs and when the second button was clicked the user received 5 (continuing down to 1 gif on the last button). I learned that even though I didn’t declare the function in the for loop, when I called a function containing another function in the for loop, all of the functions were being run each time the loop cycled through. This was a beneficial lesson to learn for future projects.
